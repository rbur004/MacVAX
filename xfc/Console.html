<A NAME="xfc_CONSOLE"></A>
<h2>Console IO</h2>
<ul>
	These calls use the console <b>IPR</b> registers to perform IO to the MacVAXC <b>I0 Window</b>.They provide a simple method of performing character IO without needing to write a device driver.
<p>
<A NAME="xfc_0"></A>
<dl>
<dt><B>XFC #READCHAR (0)</B>
<dd>Reads one character from keyboard with no echoing.  The character is returned in the low byte of <b>r0</b>.

<p>
<A NAME="xfc_1"></A>
<dt><B>XFC #WRITECHAR (1)</B>
<dd>Output one character to the I/O window.  The character is passed in the low byte of <b>r0</b>.

<p>
<A NAME="xfc_2"></A>
<dt><B>XFC #READLINE (2)</B>
<dd>Inputs one line from the keyboard (equivalent to Pascal's readln). Characters are echoed 
and erase/kill processing is performed.  On execution, <b>r0</b> must contain the address 
where the string is to be placed.  After execution <b>r0</b> points to one byte after the end of 
the string, and <b>r1</b> contains the length of the string.  An end of line character is <b>not</b> 
appended to the return string.

<p>
<A NAME="xfc_3"></A>
<dt><B>XFC #WRITESTRING (3)</B>
<dd>Output one line to the screen (equivalent to Pascal's write).  On execution, <b>r0</b> must 
contain the address of a buffer which contains the string to output, and <B>r1</B> the length of 
the string.  Characters from the buffer are output one at a time until a null byte is 
reached or <B>r1</B> characters have been written.  After execution <B>r0</B> points to the byte after 
the terminating character of the string.
