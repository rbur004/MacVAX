<h2>Comments</h2>
<ul>
Comments can be used anywhere in the program.  A semicolon starts the 
comment, and the rest of the line will be ignored.
<p>
C-style comments are also supported, using  the characters &quot/*&quot to start the comment, and following it with the characters 
&quot*/&quot.
<p>
Blank and tab characters may be used freely in the assembly language program to make 
the program more readable.  Blank lines are ignored by the assembler.
