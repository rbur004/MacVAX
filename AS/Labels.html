<h2>Labels</h2>
<ul>
A label declaration is an <a href="Identifiers.html">identifier</a> followed by a &quot:&quot.  A label is way of naming an address of a VAX instruction or of data. 
e.g.
<listing>
	Start:     ; declare the label Start 
</listing>
We can then use the label anywhere we would normally use an address.
eg.
<listing>
	brb	Start	; Note no colon is used in references to labels
</listing>
<p>
The BSD numeric labels <b>0</b> through <b>9</b> are also recognised by the assembler. Multiple numeric labels using the same number <B>may</B> exist in a program at one time. These are referenced in instructions, by appending a &quotb&quot to the number to refer to the previous label using that number, or by appending an &quotf&quot to refer to the next label using that number. eg.
<listing>
	1:	...
		movl R0, R1
		blss	2f		;branches forwards to the next label 2
		bgtr	1f		;branches forwards to the next label 1
		bequ	1b		;branches Backwards to the previous label 1
	2:  ...
	1:	...
</listing>
<h3>Nb.</h3>
	<ul>
		The assembler translates numeric labels into the form <B>L</B>n, 
		where n is a 	unique number selected to make the label unique.
	</ul>
</ul>
