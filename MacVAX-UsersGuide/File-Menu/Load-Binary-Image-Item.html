<H2>Load Binary Image Menu Item</H2>

<ul>
The Load Binary Image Item displays a Macintosh Standard dialog box prompting  the user for a file to boot. Files of ALL types will be displayed for selection. 
<p>
All running processes are terminated and the processor is initialized to a know state. The file is loaded into VAX memory at Physical address 0x00000000. No symbol table information is loaded. The Stack Pointer is set to Physical address 0x0000F000. The processor is running in kernel mode on the Interrupt Stack with virtual memory turned off. The System Control Block Base Register will contain the physical address 0x00000000. The PC will be set to 0x00000000.
<p>
The boot process is not started until the user selects &quotGo&quot from the &quotRun&quot" menu.
<p>
This differs from <A HREF="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/macvax/MacVAX-UsersGuide/File-Menu/Load-Boot-Image-Item.html">&quotLoad Boot Image&quot</A> in that the file is assumed not to have been produced by the assembler AS. Its primary function is to load code images from real VAX processors.
