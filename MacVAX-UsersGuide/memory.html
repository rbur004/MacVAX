<H2>Memory</H2>MacVAX has 256K of Physical memory (this is not user alterable and may alter from version to version). A kernel mode process can determine the amount of physical memory by reading the internal processor register <A HREF="VAX-IPR/IPL_MACVAX.html#IPL_29">MVMEM</A>. Physical addresses are considered 24 bit quantities, the top byte of each address being ignored. Virtual Memory is allocated in 512 byte pages. The mapping between physical and virtual addresses is done by the memory management hardware (see the <A HREF="VAX-IPR/IPR_MEMORY.html">Page Table Internal Processor Register</A>).
