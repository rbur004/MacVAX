	<h3>With A System</h3>
	<ul>
			If a <A HREF="../../xfc/System.html#xfc_128">Operating System</A> is present 	then the Operating System is sent an interrupt through Vector MACVAX at IPL 23 with the 	Command RESET_PROCESS in IPR(MVCR) (see <A HREF="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/macvax/MacVAX-Interrupt-Vector.html">MacVAX 	interrupt Vector</A>). What happens at this point is dependant on the OS. 
	</ul>
	<h3>Without A System</h3>
	<ul>
		If a process is loaded then all files opened by the process are closed and the 	processor is initialized. The process is then reloaded from the original file. If the 	file has changed, then the new file contents and symbol table are loaded. If the file 	is no longer present, then the call returns without performing the reset.
	<p>
		If no process is loaded then this is equivalent to <A 	HREF="../File-Menu/Init-Processor-Item.html">&quotInitial Processor&quot</A>.
