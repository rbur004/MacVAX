obtain the address of the address of the operand.</td>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>		 
<p>
	<li>&ltexpr&gt is an expression as described (see XXX).<br>
	<li>An &ltexpr&gt is evaluated at assembly time. <br>
	<li><B>R</B>n and <B>R</B>x are any registers and may be the same register (be 	careful if they you do this).<br>
	<li>The assembler recognises the UNIX;<br>
	<ul>
		&quot<B>*</B>&quot as equivalent to the VMS &quot<B>@</B>&quot;<br>
		&quot<B>$</B>&quot as equivalent to the VMS &quot<B>#</B>&quot,<br>
	</ul>
	But MacVAX will always display these in the VMS form used above.
</ul>
