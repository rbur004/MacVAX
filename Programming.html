	<h3>IO</h3>
	<ul>
	MacVAX has no external peripherals other than the console. This is accessed via the <a href="VAX-IPR/IPL_CONSOLE.html">console internal processor registers</a>. IO can be perform either by polling the Ready and Done bits of the console control registers or through an interrupt service routine. MacVAX simulates asyncronous I/O on output by calculating a random interval between the initiation of output and the Interrupt for IO completion. 
<p>
The console may also be written to or read from via the XFC <A HREF="xfc/MacVAX-XFCcalls-index.html#xfc_CONSOLE">Console IO</A> calls. These calls provide a simpler environment for introductory courses. These calls do use the console registers so the effects of IO can be observed by the student.
<p>
Disk IO can be performed only through the XFC <A HREF="xfc/MacVAX-XFCcalls-index.html#xfc_FILE">File I/O</A> calls. These provide read/write access to files on the Macintosh's disk(s). It was intended to provide a more realistic disk device which would have to be accessed via a user written device driver, but this has yet to eventuate.
